- Create issue in github

- Clone repository (git clone ..., or git pull ...)

- Create development branch (git checkout -b branchName)

- Develop, track changes via (git add filename)
   Revert added files using (git restore filename)

- Test (more to come here)

- Commit (git commit) tag issue in commit msg "#issueNumber"
   "fixes #issueNumber" closes the issue upon integration
   If you want this to remain a separate branch remotely, then use:
      "git commit -u <upstreamBranch> <thisBranch>"
   For example, starting a new branch off origin
      "git commit -u origin newBranch"
      
- Push to main branch via (git push)
